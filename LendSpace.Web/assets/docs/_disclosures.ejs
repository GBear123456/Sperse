        <h5><b>RATES AND FEES</b></h5>
        <p>Only a lender orlending partner can provide you with information on their rates and terms. This
            will typically happen shortly after your loan request is complete, and you are connected with a
            lender or lending partner. LendSpace does not make credit decisions or determine rates and
            terms. Remember, you are under no obligation to accept the loan offer if the terms are not
            satisfactory for whatever reason.
        </p>

        <h5><b>Repayment</b></h5>

        <p>Repayment on personal loans is generally performed either monthly or once every two weeks,
            depending
            either on your preferences or your lender's or lending partner's terms. You may be able to have
            funds withdrawn automatically from your bank account on the date agreed upon with your lender or
            lending partner. Be sure that you read and fully understand all policies regarding repayment and
            understand what you will have to do as a borrower to repay the loan. Your loan cannot be
            conditioned upon repayment by electronic funds transfer or automatic withdrawal. Consult your
            lender or lending partner for more details.</p>

        <h5><b>Personal Loan Costs</b></h5>

        <p>On the whole, the eventual cost of a personal loan will vary a great deal based on factors
            related to the requester, the state the requester lives in, the lender or lending partner, and
            the requester's repayment. Other factors that matter are the amount of money that is borrowed,
            the period of time of the loan and the specific interest rates used. Your credit score may also
            be taken into consideration.</p>

        <h5><b>Standard Personal Loan Terms</b></h5>

        <p>While specific terms of personal loans will vary depending on your state, your lender or lending
            partner and your specific circumstances, below is a general range of common terms.</p>
    </div>

    <ul>
        <li>Loan amount: Varies by Lender</li>
        <li>Lending period: Varies by Lender</li>
        <li>Payment frequency: Once a month or twice a month</li>
        <li>APR: Will vary based on your credit score, repayment history and other factors</li>
        <li>Prepayment penalty: Varies by Lender</li>
    </ul>

    <h5><b>FAIR CREDIT REPORTING ACT (FCRA)</b></h5>

    <p>The federal Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) promotes the accuracy, fairness, and privacy of
        information in the files of consumer reporting agencies. There are many types of consumer reporting
        agencies, including credit bureaus and specialty agencies (such as agencies that sell information
        about check writing histories, medical records, and rental history records).</p>

    <p>Here is a summary of your major rights under FCRA. <b>For more information, including information
        about additional rights, go to <u><a href="http://www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore" target="_blank"><span>www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore</span></a></u>
        or write to: Consumer Financial Protection
        Bureau, 1700 G Street N.W., Washington, DC 20552.</b></p>

    <p><b>You must be told if information in your file has
        been used against you.</b> Anyone
        who uses a credit report or another type of consumer report to deny your
        application for credit, insurance, or employment - or to take another adverse
        action against you - must tell you, and must give you the name, address, and
        phone number of the agency that provided the information. If you have not
        received this information, please contact the lending or financial institution
        you were connected with.</p>

    <p><b>You have the right to know what is in your file. </b>You may request and obtain all the
        information
        about you in the files of a consumer reporting agency (your "file disclosure"). You will be required
        to provide proper identification, which may include your Social Security number or other personally
        identifiable information. In many cases, the disclosure will be free. You are entitled to a free
        file disclosure if:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>A person has taken adverse
            action against you because of information in your credit report;</li>
        <li>You are the victim of identity
            theft and place a fraud alert in your file;</li>
        <li>Your file contains inaccurate
            information as a result of fraud;</li>
        <li>You are on public assistance;</li>
        <li>You are unemployed but expect
            to apply for employment within 60 days.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>In addition, all consumers are entitled to one free disclosure every 12 months upon request from each
        nationwide credit bureau and from nationwide specialty consumer reporting agencies. See <u><a
            href="http://www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore" target="_blank"><span>www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore</span></a></u> for additional information.</p>

    <p><b>You have the right to ask for a credit score.</b> Credit scores are numerical summaries of your
        credit-worthiness based on information from credit bureaus. You may request a credit score from
        consumer reporting agencies that create scores or distribute scores used in residential real
        property loans, but you will have to pay for it. In some mortgage transactions, you will receive
        credit score information for free from the mortgage lender.</p>

    <p><b>You have the right to dispute incomplete or inaccurate information.</b> If you identify
        information in your file that is incomplete or inaccurate, and report it to the consumer reporting
        agency, the agency must investigate unless your dispute is frivolous. See <u><a
            href="http://www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore" target="_blank"><span>www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore</span></a></u> for an explanation of dispute procedures.</p>

    <p><b>Consumer reporting agencies must correct or delete inaccurate, incomplete, or unverifiable
        information.</span></b> Inaccurate, incomplete, or unverifiable information must be removed or
        corrected, usually within 30 days. However, a consumer reporting agency may continue to report
        information it has verified as accurate.</p>

    <p><b>Consumer reporting agencies may not report outdated negative information. </b> In most cases, a
        consumer reporting agency may not report negative information that is more than seven years old, or
        bankruptcies that are more than 10 years old.</p>

    <p><b>Access to your file is limited.</b> A consumer reporting agency may provide
        information about you only to people with a valid need - usually to consider an
        application with a creditor, insurer, employer, landlord, or other business.
        The FCRA specifies those with a valid need for access.</p>

    <p><b>You must give your consent for reports to be
        provided to employers.</b> A
        consumer reporting agency may not give out information about you to your employer,
        or a potential employer, without your written consent given to the employer.
        Written consent generally is not required in the trucking industry. For more
        information, go to<u><a href="http://consumerfinance.gov/learnmore" target="_blank">
            www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore</a></u>.</p>

    <p><b>You may limit "prescreened" offers of credit and
        insurance you get based on information in your credit report.</b> Unsolicited "prescreened" offers
        for credit and
        insurance must include a toll-free phone number you can call if you choose to
        remove your name and address form the lists these offers are based on. You may
        opt out with the nationwide credit bureaus at 1-888-5-OPTOUT (1-888-567-8688).</p>

    <p>The following FCRA right applies with respect to
        nationwide consumer reporting agencies:</p>

    <h5><b>CONSUMERS HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBTAIN A SECURITY
        FREEZE</b></h5>

    <p><b>You have a right to place a "security freeze" on your credit report, which will
        prohibit a consumer reporting agency from releasing information in your credit
        report without your express authorization.</b> The security freeze is designed to prevent credit,
        loans, and services from being approved in your name without your consent.
        However, you should be aware that using a security freeze to take control over
        who gets access to the personal and financial information in your credit report
        may delay, interfere with, or prohibit the timely approval of any subsequent
        request or application you make regarding a new loan, credit, mortgage, or any
        other account involving the extension of credit.</p>

    <p>As an alternative to a security freeze, you have
        the right to place an initial or extended fraud alert on your credit file at no
        cost. An initial fraud alert is a 1-year alert that is placed on a consumer's
        credit file. Upon seeing a fraud alert display on a consumer's credit file, a
        business is required to take steps to verify the consumer's identity before
        extending new credit. If you are a victim of identity theft, you are entitled
        to an extended fraud alert, which is a fraud alert lasting 7 years.</p>

    <p>A security freeze does not apply to a person or
        entity, or its affiliates, or collection agencies acting on behalf of the
        person or entity, with which you have an existing account that requests
        information in your credit report for the purposes of reviewing or collecting the
        account. Reviewing the account includes activities related to account
        maintenance, monitoring, credit line increases, and account upgrades and
        enhancements.</p>

    <p>
        Identity theft victims and active duty military
        personnel have additional rights. For more information, visit
        <u>

                <span>www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore</span></a>
        </u>.
    </p>

    <p><b>States may enforce the FCRA, and many states have
        their own consumer reporting laws.? In some cases, you may have more rights
        under state law. For more information, contact your state or local consumer
        protection agency or your state Attorney General. For information about your
        federal rights, contact:</b></p>

    <h5><b>PRE-QUALIFICATION PLATFORM TERMS FOR LOANS</b></h5>
    <p><i>Please read this information carefully and print a copy and/or retain this information for future reference.</i></p>

    <p>LendSpace's Loan Pre-Qualification Platform (the "Loan Pre-Qualification Platform") is a tool that helps you find pre-qualified offers for financial product with greater ease and certainty. By signing up for and using the Loan Pre-Qualification Platform, you agree to the following terms:</p>

    <p><b>1. Permission to Share Information.</b> I authorize LendSpace to periodically share personal profile information it has collected about me with current or future participating loan providers or loan platforms ("participating providers") so that they can identify and return certain "prequalified" personal loan, auto loan, small business loan or student loan offers (each such submission, a "pre-qualified offer request").</p>

    <p><b>2. Permission for Participating Providers to Make Soft Inquiries; No Impact to Credit Score.</b> I authorize each participating provider to obtain and use consumer report information about me from one or more consumer reporting agencies (such as TransUnion, Equifax or Experian). These soft inquiries will not impact my credit score and my consumer report information will be used solely in connection with identifying and providing me with pre-qualified offers.</p>

    <p><b>3. Offers Not Guaranteed; Application Still Required.</b> I understand that receiving pre-qualified offers through LendSpace's Loan Pre-Qualification Platform does not guarantee approval and I will still need to submit an application with participating providers. While checking for pre-qualified offers does not result in a hard inquiry or affect my credit score, I understand that if I choose to apply for a pre-qualified offer with a participating provider, that provider may run a hard inquiry, which can impact my credit score.</p>

    <p><b>4. Available Products Subject to Change.</b> I understand that many, but not all, financial service providers participate in the Loan Pre-Qualification Platform and that the platform may not include every product offered by participating providers. I further understand that LendSpace will determine, in its sole discretion, when, how often, and with which participating providers it checks for pre-qualified offers based on criteria from each participating provider, availability of information needed to identify prequalified offers and other relevant factors.</p>

    <p><b>5. Electronic Communications Consent.</b> I consent to receive communications about pre-qualified offer requests electronically from participating providers or LendSpace as described in these E-Consent Terms. These electronic communications include responses to pre-qualified offer requests, any applicable notices or disclosures required by law and, when enabled, the notifications about offers described in the following paragraph.</p>

    <p><b>6. Notifications About New or Recommended Offers (optional).</b> I understand and agree that LendSpace will send me email or push notifications to tell me about recommended pre-qualified offers I receive from pre-qualified offer requests submitted on my behalf. I understand that I can adjust my Communications &amp; Monitoring Settings to turn off these offer notifications.</p>

    <p><b>7. One-Year Enrollment Period.</b> I understand that my enrollment in the Loan Pre-Qualification Platform and the authorizations granted herein will remain valid for a one-year period.</p>

    <h5><b>PRE-QUALIFICATION PLATFORM TERMS FOR CREDIT CARDS</b></h5>

    <p>LendSpace's Credit Card Pre-Qualification Platform (the "CC Pre-Qualification Platform") is a tool that helps you find pre-qualified offers for financial products with greater ease and certainty. By signing up for and using the CC Pre-Qualification Platform, you agree to the following terms:</p>

    <p><b>1. Permission to Share Information.</b> I authorize LendSpace to periodically share personal profile information it has collected about me with current or future participating credit card issuers ("participating issuers") so that they can identify and return certain "prequalified" credit card offers (each such submission, a "pre-qualified offer request").</p>

    <p><b>2. Permission for Participating Issuers to Make Soft Inquiries; No Impact to Credit Score.</b> I authorize each participating issuer to obtain and use consumer report information about me from one or more consumer reporting agencies (such as TransUnion, Equifax or Experian). These soft inquiries will not impact my credit score and my consumer report information will be used solely in connection with identifying and providing me with pre-qualified offers.</p>

    <p><b>3. Offers Not Guaranteed; Application Still Required.</b> I understand that requesting pre-qualified offers through LendSpace's CC Pre-Qualification Platform is not an application for credit and does not guarantee approval. I also understand that I will still need to submit an application with participating issuers. While checking for pre-qualified offers does not result in a hard inquiry or affect my credit score, I understand that if I choose to apply for a pre-qualified offer with a participating issuer, that issuer may run a hard inquiry, which can impact my credit score.</p>

    <p><b>4. Notifications About New or Recommended Offers (optional).</b> I understand and agree that LendSpace may send me email or push notifications to tell me about recommended pre-qualified offers I receive from pre-qualified offer requests submitted on my behalf. I understand that I can adjust my Communications &amp; Monitoring Settings to turn off these offer notifications.</p>

    <p><b>5. Canceling Enrollment.</b> I understand that I can cancel my enrollment in the CC Pre-Qualification Platform by visiting my Communications &amp; Monitoring Settings.</p>
