<h2 class="doc-title">LENDER RATES &amp; FEES</h2>
<p>Only a lender or lending partner can provide you with information on their
    rates and terms. This will typically happen shortly after your loan
    request is complete, and you are connected with a lender or lending
    partner. LendSpace does not make credit decisions or determine rates
    and terms. Remember, you are under no obligation to accept the loan
    offer if the terms are not satisfactory for whatever reason.
</p>

<p>Repayment
    on personal loans is generally performed either monthly or once every
    two weeks, depending either on your preferences or your lender's or
    lending partner’s terms. You may be able to have funds withdrawn
    automatically from your bank account on the date agreed upon with
    your lender or lending partner. Be sure that you read and fully
    understand all policies regarding repayment and understand what you
    will have to do as a borrower to repay the loan. Your loan cannot be
    conditioned upon repayment by electronic funds transfer or automatic
    withdrawal. Consult your lender or lending partner for more details.
</p>

<p>On the whole, the eventual cost of a personal loan will vary a great
    deal based on factors related to the requester, the state the
    requester lives in, the lender or lending partner, and the
    requester's repayment. Other factors that matter are the amount of
    money that is borrowed, the period of time of the loan and the
    specific interest rates used. Your credit score may also be taken
    into consideration.
</p>

<p>While specific terms of personal loans will vary depending on your state,
    your lender or lending partner and your specific circumstances, below
    is a general range of common terms.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Loan amount: Varies by Lender</li>
    <li>Lending period: Varies by Lender
    </li>
    <li>Payment frequency: Once a month or twice a mont
