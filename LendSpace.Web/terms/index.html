                                        <b>Binding Arbitration</b>.
                                            The parties agree to submit any dispute arising out of or in any way
                                            relating to this Site to binding arbitration conducted by a single
                                            arbitrator under the Commercial Rules of the American Arbitration
                                            Association ("AAA") in Los Angeles, California, rather than a
                                            proceeding in a court of law. Any such arbitrator shall be
                                            knowledgeable in the subject area in which the dispute arises. All
                                            discovery shall be completed within sixty (60) days following the
                                            appointment of the arbitrator. Each party shall be entitled to
                                            representation by counsel, to appear and present written and oral
                                            evidence and argument and to cross-examine witnesses presented by the
                                            other party, provided that, where appropriate, the arbitrator may
                                            receive testimony via telephone, video or other electronic means of
                                            communication. The arbitration aware shall be in writing and the
                                            arbitrator shall provide written reasons for the award. The award of
                                            the arbitrator shall be final and binding on the parties hereto and
                                            may be enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction. The
                                            prevailing party in any action or proceeding to enforce its rights
                                            hereunder shall be entitled to recover reasonable attorneys' fees
                                            and other reasonable costs, including fees of the arbitrator and the
                                            AAA, incurred in the action or proceedings. In no event shall the
                                            arbiter award punitive or exemplary damages. The parties waive any
                                            right they may have to an appeal of the arbitrator's decision
                                            and/or award. Each party retains the right to seek judicial
                                            assistance: (i) to compel arbitration, (ii) to obtain interim
                                            measures of protection prior to or pending arbitration, (iii) to seek
                                            injunctive relief in the courts of any jurisdiction as may be
                                            necessary and appropriate to protect the unauthorized disclosure of
                                            its proprietary or confidential information; (iv) for any claims of
                                            infringement or misappropriation of LendSpace's patent, copyright,
                                            trademark, or trade secrets; and (v) to enforce any decision of the
                                            arbitrator, including the final award. If any AAA rule conflicts with
                                            these Terms and Conditions, these Terms and Conditions shall control.
                                            By agreeing to arbitration, you agree that the parties are each
                                            waiving the right to file a lawsuit and the right to a trial by jury
                                            in any action in any way arising out of or related to this agreement.
                                            Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, any party to the
                                            arbitration may at any time seek injunctions or other forms of
                                            equitable relief from any court of competent jurisdiction.
