                The parties agree to submit any dispute arising out of or in any way
                relating to this Site to binding arbitration conducted by a single
                arbitrator under the Commercial Rules of the American Arbitration
                Association ("AAA") in Los Angeles, California, rather than a
                proceeding in a court of law. Any such arbitrator shall be
                knowledgeable in the subject area in which the dispute arises. All
                discovery shall be completed within sixty (60) days following the
                appointment of the arbitrator. Each party shall be entitled to
                representation by counsel, to appear and present written and oral
                evidence and argument and to cross-examine witnesses presented by the
                other party, provided that, where appropriate, the arbitrator may
                receive testimony via telephone, video or other electronic means of
                communication. The arbitration aware shall be in writing and the
                arbitrator shall provide written reasons for the award. The award of
                the arbitrator shall be final and binding on the parties hereto and
                may be enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction. The
                prevailing party in any action or proceeding to enforce its rights
                hereunder shall be entitled to recover reasonable attorneys' fees
                and other reasonable costs, including fees of the arbitrator and the
                AAA, incurred in the action or proceedings. In no event shall the
                arbiter award punitive or exemplary damages. The parties waive any
                right they may have to an appeal of the arbitrator's decision
                and/or award. Each party retains the right to seek judicial
                assistance: (i) to compel arbitration, (ii) to obtain interim
                measures of protection prior to or pending arbitration, (iii) to seek
                injunctive relief in the courts of any jurisdiction as may be
                necessary and appropriate to protect the unauthorized disclosure of
                its proprietary or confidential information; (iv) for any claims of
                infringement or misappropriation of LendSpace's patent, copyright,
                trademark, or trade secrets; and (v) to enforce any decision of the
                arbitrator, including the final award. If any AAA rule conflicts with
                these Terms and Conditions, these Terms and Conditions shall control.
                By agreeing to arbitration, you agree that the parties are each
                waiving the right to file a lawsuit and the right to a trial by jury
                in any action in any way arising out of or related to this agreement.
                Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, any party to the
                arbitration may at any time seek injunctions or other forms of
                equitable relief from any court of competent jurisdiction. </font></font>

                For all disputes you may have, whether pursued in court or arbitration, you must first give LendSpace an opportunity to resolve the dispute 
                by providing written notification to info@LendSpace.com and via postal mail to LendSpace, LLC, 15 Second St. Suite 414, Millennium Park Plaza, 
                Guaynabo, PR 00968 stating (i) your name, (ii) your address, (iii) a written description of your claim, and (iv) a description of the specific relief you seek. 
                If LendSpace does not resolve the dispute within 30 days after it receives your notification, you may pursue your dispute as set forth above.  </font></font>

                To the extent allowed by law, you and LendSpace each agree to waive
                any right to pursue disputes on a consolidated or class-wide basis;
                that is, to either join a claim with the claim of any other person or
                entity, or assert a claim in a representative capacity on behalf of
                anyone else in any lawsuit, arbitration, or other proceeding. You
                hereby understand that by agreeing to this class action waiver, you
                may only bring claims against LendSpace in an individual capacity and
                not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action or
