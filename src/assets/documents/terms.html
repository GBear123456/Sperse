                        term, upon thirty (30) days prior notice to You (which may be sent by email). If You believe
                        that We have billed You incorrectly, You must contact Us no later than 30 days after the closing
                        date on the first billing statement in which the error or problem appeared, in order to receive

                        Unpaid amounts are subject to a late fee and a finance charge of 2.0% per month on any
                        outstanding balance, or the maximum permitted by law, whichever is lower, plus all expenses of
                        collection and may result in immediate termination of Services. You shall be responsible for all

                        thirty (30) days prior to the end of the then-current term.</li>
                    <li>In addition to any other remedies it may have, either party may also terminate this Agreement
                        upon thirty (30) days’ notice (or without notice in the case of nonpayment), if the other party
                        materially breaches any of the terms or conditions of this Agreement. You will pay in full for
                        the Services up to and including the last day on which the Services are provided. Upon any
