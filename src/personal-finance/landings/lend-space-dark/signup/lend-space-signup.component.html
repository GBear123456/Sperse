        <h4>Disclosure</h4>
        <p>
            LendSpace is not a lender. The LendSpace website does not offer or provide loans, but rather, it offers a service to match users
            to suitable financial services.
            It should not be construed as a lending agent or broker. The site does not endorse any lenders and does not charge visitors any
            fees.
            The website owners do not evaluate potential lenders’ applications, nor do they approve or deny credit.
            The LendSpace website gathers applicants’ personal information and transmits it to lenders that are part of the site’s lending
            network.
            No one is required to make use of this website, nor are they under any obligation to begin contact with site operators or to
            attempt to secure a loan with any of the site’s lending partners.
            Some, but not all, lenders may offer loans of up to $35,000, and loans tend to range between $500 and $35,000.
            Transmission of your financial and personal information on the website in no way obligates lenders to offer you a loan or any
            other kind of credit product.
            Be aware that cash transfer times can vary, depending on the lender and the bank you use. It may be necessary to fax information
            under certain circumstances.
            All questions about loans, and any concerns you may have should be directed to your lender. These loans are intended as
            short-term financial solution to satisfy borrowers’ needs for immediate monetary relief.
            This is not intended to be part of a long-term financial plan for individuals. These services are not offered in all states.
            Potential borrows may undergo credit check if lenders choose to use any of the major credit reporting bureaus, including
            Equifax, Trans Union and Experian.
            They may also use other alternative sources to check credit ratings. Your request for a loan constitutes your agreement and
            acknowledgement that (A) your personal data may be shared with lenders and perhaps other third-party partners,
            and (B) lenders can acquire credit bureau reports that detail your credit history. Reports from major credit bureaus, such as
            Equifax, Experian and TransUnion may be obtained and used to evaluate your reliability as a borrower.
